Been a while since I tried Jekyll. I want to move subtilis-software to something where I can link to my other sites, and perhaps blog about updates to Answer Brawl, Where Dark Things Sleep, and other topics. Github is where I visit every day as a developer and feels like an appropriate place to host my static site.
