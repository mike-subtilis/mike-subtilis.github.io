Been a while since I tried Jekyll. I want to move subtilis-software to something where I can link to my other sites, and perhaps blog about updates to [AnswerBrawl](https://answerbrawl.com), [Where Dark Things Sleep](https://bowrivergames.com), and other topics. Github is where I visit every day as a developer and feels like an appropriate place to host my static site.
